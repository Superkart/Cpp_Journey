# C++ Journey

This repository contains my learning and practice of C++ programming. It includes basic syntax, modern C++ features, data structures, algorithms, and small projects. It also documents the setup steps for a C++ development environment on Windows using MSYS2, MinGW-w64, and Visual Studio Code.

## Goals

- Learn C++ syntax and best practices
- Practice modern C++ (C++11 and later)
- Work on data structures and algorithms
- Build small C++ projects

## Environment Setup

This project uses MSYS2 with MinGW-w64 and Visual Studio Code on Windows.

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11
- MSYS2: https://www.msys2.org/
- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Setup Steps

- Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/ and run the installer.
- Open MSYS2 terminal and update:


pacman -Syu

Close and reopen the terminal if asked, then run:
pacman -Su

- Install MinGW-w64 (GCC and G++):
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc

- Add `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to your system PATH.
- Install Visual Studio Code and the C/C++ extension by Microsoft.
- Verify g++ works by running:
g++ --version

## How to Build and Run

### Command Line

To compile and run a C++ file from the terminal:

g++ filename.cpp -o filename
./filename


### Visual Studio Code

This repository includes a preconfigured `.vscode/tasks.json` file to build the currently active `.cpp` file in VS Code.

Steps:

1. Open this repository folder in VS Code.
2. Open the `.cpp` file you want to build.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build it.
4. This creates an `.exe` file with the same name as the `.cpp` file in the same folder.
5. Run the program in the terminal:
./filename.exe

Notes:

- The `.vscode/tasks.json` file dynamically builds whichever `.cpp` file you currently have open.
- The build does not automatically run the program â€” you need to run the `.exe` manually as shown above.
